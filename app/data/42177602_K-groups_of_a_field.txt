In mathematics, especially in algebraic K-theory, the algebraic K-group of a field is important to compute. For a finite field, the complete calculation was given by Daniel Quillen. ==Low degrees== The map sending a finite- dimensional F-vector space to its dimension induces an isomorphism :K_0(F) \cong \mathbf Z for any field F. Next, :K_1(F) = F^\times, the multiplicative group of F. The second K-group of a field is described in terms of generators and relations by Matsumoto's theorem. == Finite fields == The K-groups of finite fields are one of the few cases where the K-theory is known completely: for n \ge 1, :K_n(\mathbb{F}_q) = \pi_n(BGL(\mathbb{F}_q)^+) \simeq \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z}/{(q^i - 1)}, & \text{if }n = 2i - 1 \\\ 0, & \text{if }n\text{ is even} \end{cases} For n=2, this can be seen from Matsumoto's theorem, in higher degrees it was computed by Quillen in conjunction with his work on the Adams conjecture. A different proof was given by . == Local and global fields == surveys the computations of K-theory of global fields (such as number fields and function fields), as well as local fields (such as p-adic numbers). == Algebraically closed fields== showed that the torsion in K-theory is insensitive to extensions of algebraically closed fields. This statement is known as Suslin rigidity. == See also == *divisor class group == References == * * * * Category:Algebraic geometry
